        <h1>His Life</h1>
        <h2 class="h2-heading">Early Life</h2>
        <br />
        <p>Shakespeare was the son of John Shakespeare, an alderman and a successful glover (glove-maker) originally from
        Snitterfield in Warwickshire, and Mary Arden, the daughter of an affluent landowning family. He was born in
        Stratford-upon-Avon, where he was baptised on 26 April 1564. His date of birth is unknown, but is traditionally observed
        on 23 April, Saint George's Day. This date, which can be traced to William Oldys and George Steevens, has proved
        appealing to biographers because Shakespeare died on the same date in 1616. He was the third of eight children,
        and the eldest surviving son.</p>
        <p>Although no attendance records for the period survive, most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at
        the King's New School in Stratford, a free school chartered in 1553, about a quarter-mile (400 m) from
        his home. Grammar schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era, but grammar school curricula were largely
        similar: the basic Latin text was standardised by royal decree, and the school would have provided an intensive
        education in grammar based upon Latin classical authors.</p>
        <p>At the age of 18, Shakespeare married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway. The consistory court of the Diocese of Worcester issued
        a marriage licence on 27 November 1582. The next day, two of Hathaway's neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that no
        lawful claims impeded the marriage. The ceremony may have been arranged in some haste since the Worcester chancellor
        allowed the marriage banns to be read once instead of the usual three times, and six months after the marriage
        Anne gave birth to a daughter, Susanna, baptised 26 May 1583. Twins, son Hamnet and daughter Judith, followed almost
        two years later and were baptised 2 February 1585. Hamnet died of unknown causes at the age of 11 and was buried 11
        August 1596.</p>
        <p>Shakespeare's coat of arms, from the 1602 book The book of coates and creasts. Promptuarium armorum. It features spears
        as a pun on the family name.
        After the birth of the twins, Shakespeare left few historical traces until he is mentioned as part of the London theatre
        scene in 1592. The exception is the appearance of his name in the "complaints bill" of a law case before the Queen's
        Bench court at Westminster dated Michaelmas Term 1588 and 9 October 1589. Scholars refer to the years between 1585
        and 1592 as Shakespeare's "lost years". Biographers attempting to account for this period have reported many
        apocryphal stories. Nicholas Rowe, Shakespeare's first biographer, recounted a Stratford legend that Shakespeare fled
        the town for London to escape prosecution for deer poaching in the estate of local squire Thomas Lucy. Shakespeare is
        also supposed to have taken his revenge on Lucy by writing a scurrilous ballad about him. Another 18th-century
        story has Shakespeare starting his theatrical career minding the horses of theatre patrons in London. John Aubrey
        reported that Shakespeare had been a country schoolmaster. Some 20th-century scholars suggested that Shakespeare may
        have been employed as a schoolmaster by Alexander Hoghton of Lancashire, a Catholic landowner who named a certain
        "William Shakeshafte" in his will. Little evidence substantiates such stories other than hearsay collected after
        his death, and Shakeshafte was a common name in the Lancashire area.</p>
        <br />
        <h2 class="h2-heading">Career</h2>
        <br />
        <p>It is not known definitively when Shakespeare began writing, but contemporary allusions and records of performances show
        that several of his plays were on the London stage by 1592. By then, he was sufficiently known in London to be
        attacked in print by the playwright Robert Greene in his Groats-Worth of Wit from that year:</p>
        <p class="indent-paragraph">... there is an upstart Crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his Tiger's heart wrapped in a Player's hide,
        supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blank verse as the best of you: and being an absolute Johannes factotum, is
        in his own conceit the only Shake-scene in a country.</p>
        <p>Scholars differ on the exact meaning of Greene's words, but most agree that Greene was accusing Shakespeare of
        reaching above his rank in trying to match such university-educated writers as Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Nashe, and
        Greene himself (the so-called "University Wits"). The italicised phrase parodying the line "Oh, tiger's heart
        wrapped in a woman's hide" from Shakespeare's Henry VI, Part 3, along with the pun "Shake-scene", clearly identify
        Shakespeare as Greene's target. As used here, Johannes Factotum ("Jack of all trades") refers to a second-rate tinkerer
        with the work of others, rather than the more common "universal genius".</p>
        <p>Greene's attack is the earliest surviving mention of Shakespeare's work in the theatre. Biographers suggest that his
        career may have begun any time from the mid-1580s to just before Greene's remarks. After 1594, Shakespeare's
        plays were performed only by the Lord Chamberlain's Men, a company owned by a group of players, including Shakespeare,
        that soon became the leading playing company in London. After the death of Queen Elizabeth in 1603, the company was
        awarded a royal patent by the new King James I, and changed its name to the King's Men.</p>
        <p>All the world's a stage,</p>
        <p>and all the men and women merely players:</p>
        <p>they have their exits and their entrances;</p>
        <p>and one man in his time plays many parts ...</p>
        <p>â€”As You Like It, Act II, Scene 7, 139-142</p>
        <p>In 1599, a partnership of members of the company built their own theatre on the south bank of the River Thames, which
        they named the Globe. In 1608, the partnership also took over the Blackfriars indoor theatre. Extant records of
        Shakespeare's property purchases and investments indicate that his association with the company made him a wealthy
        man, and in 1597, he bought the second-largest house in Stratford, New Place, and in 1605, invested in a share of
        the parish tithes in Stratford.</p>
        <p>Some of Shakespeare's plays were published in quarto editions, beginning in 1594, and by 1598, his name had become a
        selling point and began to appear on the title pages. Shakespeare continued to act in his own and other
        plays after his success as a playwright. The 1616 edition of Ben Jonson's Works names him on the cast lists for Every
        Man in His Humour (1598) and Sejanus His Fall (1603). The absence of his name from the 1605 cast list for Jonson's
        Volpone is taken by some scholars as a sign that his acting career was nearing its end. The First Folio of 1623,
        however, lists Shakespeare as one of "the Principal Actors in all these Plays", some of which were first staged after
        Volpone, although one cannot know for certain which roles he played. In 1610, John Davies of Hereford wrote that
        "good Will" played "kingly" roles. In 1709, Rowe passed down a tradition that Shakespeare played the ghost of
        Hamlet's father. Later traditions maintain that he also played Adam in As You Like It, and the Chorus in Henry
        V, though scholars doubt the sources of that information.[63]</p>
        <p>Throughout his career, Shakespeare divided his time between London and Stratford. In 1596, the year before he bought New
        Place as his family home in Stratford, Shakespeare was living in the parish of St Helen's, Bishopsgate, north of the
        River Thames. He moved across the river to Southwark by 1599, the same year his company constructed the Globe
        Theatre there. By 1604, he had moved north of the river again, to an area north of St Paul's Cathedral with many
        fine houses. There, he rented rooms from a French Huguenot named Christopher Mountjoy, a maker of women's wigs and other
        headgear.</p>
